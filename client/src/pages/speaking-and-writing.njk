                        Poppiendiek - the other bottleneck

                        Since I started working with startups in 2012 I have spent
                        a lot of my time here

                        It constitutes the 'dark matter' which is often neglected
                        as people look only at the more visible aspects of tech
                        such as the user interface or feature requests

                        AWS
                        Terraform
                        GCP
                        Open Telemetry

                        One thing common to all parts of my practice is story telling LINK
