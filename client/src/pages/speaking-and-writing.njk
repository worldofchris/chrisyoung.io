                        Common to all parts of my practice is storytelling.

                        In strategy and planning you are creating and then telling a
                        story which shows the way forward

                        In software development User Stories and Specification by Example

                        The tests tell another story

                        Metrics

                        Operations and infrastructure metrics too

                        We affect change through stories which are compelling enough
                        to bring people with us.

                        The origins of the internet
